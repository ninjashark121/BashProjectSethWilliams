# What does this do?

I created a script and used AI to create an example log file. I think this is most useful because it can take a random log file and can give you information that is inside of it. This script can analyze log files and sort them by date and then tell you what error codes are in the file based on what you specify in the the prompts. For example if you want to see ERROR messages you can just get errors and it will type them out in the terminal. 

# Why is this useful?

This script is useful because if you have a huge log file or multiple log files it can be daunting to examine or see what is in them. With this script you can analyze certain aspects of a log file without having to look through the entire thing. In this example there is a very small log file, but it works with larger files as well.
